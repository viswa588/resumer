# Profile Section Adjustments

To decrease the width of the profile image and reduce the height of the profile section, make the following changes in the Profile.jsx file:

1. For the profile image container/img element, modify the classes to:
```jsx
className="w-32 h-32" // Reduced from likely w-40 h-40 or similar
```

2. For the profile section container, modify the classes to:
```jsx
className="h-auto max-h-48" // Reduced height to show more jobs below
```

If the profile section has padding, you may also want to reduce it:
```jsx
className="py-4" // Reduced from likely py-6 or py-8
```

These Tailwind CSS changes will:
- Reduce the profile image width and height to 8rem (128px)
- Limit the profile section height to 12rem (192px)
- Create more space for the jobs list to be visible

Remember to adjust these values based on your specific design needs. You can increase or decrease the numbers (e.g., w-28, h-40) to fine-tune the sizing.
